I finally published my very first article on CSS-Tricks. I wanted to write a clear guideline of how a good PostCSS plugin should be made and help developers get started. I’m suprised of the amazing response it got from the community, it seem to have helped a lot of people to understand the core behind PostCSS.

Thank you for all kind words, rewteets and e-mails.
