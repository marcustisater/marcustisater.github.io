Last week we organized our seventh local WordPress meetup in Stockholm üôå and for this one we wanted to give a preview of the new upcoming WordPress editor, Gutenberg. We had 8 particpants who was willing to give it a try, some were developers and others fairly new to WordPress.

It was very interesting to see how the users approached it, all the tests were very unique and fun to watch.

Watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iWRBLCP-l0) and please let me know if you want me to upload any raw footage from any of the tests.

The test consisted of five tasks testing Gutenbergs features.

### Question 1 - "Change the headline from "1.0 Is The Loneliest Number" to "1.0 Is Not The Loneliest Number"

### What was your overall impression of Gutenberg?

![overall](/assets/overall.png)

# üëç
  * Toolbar is accessible and close by.
  * Keyboard shortcuts like `ctrl + b` for bold.
  * Minimalistic for front-end editing

# üëé
  * Skeptical about the add content button icon.
  * Finding the quote and headline button was difficult.
  * There is no context clicking

I will for sure follow up on the Gutenberg editor development process till it's live. I'm excited! Are you? Let me [know](https://twitter.com/MarcusTister).
