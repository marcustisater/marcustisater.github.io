Last week we organized our seventh local WordPress meetup in Stockholm üôå and for this one we wanted to show a preview of the new upcoming WordPress editor, Gutenberg. We had 8 particpants who was willing to give it a try.

It was very interesting to see how the users approached the editor, all the tests were very unique and fun to watch.

Watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iWRBLCP-l0) and let me know if you want me to upload any raw footage from any of the tests!

### What was your overall impression of Gutenberg?

![overall](/assets/overall.png)

# üëç
  * Toolbar is accessible and close by while editing.
  * Keyboard shortcuts like `ctrl + b` for bold. Shortcuts in general.
  * Moving blocks of content with up/down arrows.
  * Minimalistic for front-end editing.
  * Self-descriptive.

# üëé
  * Skeptical about the way you add new blocks of content.
  * Finding the quote and headline button was difficult.
  * No context clicking.
  * New is scary (learning phase).

I will for sure follow up on the Gutenberg editor development. I'm super excited! Are you? Let me [know](https://twitter.com/MarcusTister).
