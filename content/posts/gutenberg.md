Last week we organized our seventh local WordPress meetup in Stockholm ðŸ™Œ and for this one we wanted to do a preview of the new upcoming WordPress editor, Gutenberg. We had 8 particpants who was willing to give it a try, some were developers and others fairly new to WordPress.

### Question 1 - "Change the headline from "1.0 Is The Loneliest Number" to "1.0 Is Not The Loneliest Number"

.......

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean posuere, tortor sed cursus feugiat, nunc augue blandit nunc, eu sollicitudin urna dolor sagittis lacus. Nunc nonummy metus. Nam adipiscing.

### Question 2 - "Make the paragraph "Many entrepreneurs idolize Steve Jobs." bold"

There seem to be two approaches for this one, either select the text and click on the bold button from the toolbar or simply use the in built shortcut `"ctrl+b"`.

### Question 4 - "Format any paragraph into a quote"

This was tricky one. The fastest time was 20 sec and one did it in 2:15mins. Why is that? People were looking for something they thought was hidden.

### What was your overall impression of Gutenberg?

Phasellus consectetuer vestibulum elit. Fusce commodo aliquam arcu. Suspendisse feugiat. Suspendisse nisl elit, rhoncus eget, elementum ac, condimentum eget, diam.

## My own reflections:

I wanted people to enjoy the actual user test, making the test both fun and short was something that everyone really apperichated. I will follow up on the Gutenberg editor development and maybe give people another try at it to see it's improvements!
