I helped organize [WordCamp Stockholm 2016](http://2016.stockholm.wordcamp.org/) at [Internetdagarna](internetdagarna.se).

Lead the development of [postcss.org](http://postcss.org) and trying to actively update it. I also helped with the [brand](https://github.com/postcss/brand).

I developed [WordPress Sveriges](http://wpsv.se) new theme in WordPress together with [Mattias Tengblad](http://eyesx.com/) -  [https://github.com/wpsvse/wpsvse/](https://github.com/wpsvse/wpsvse/).

I have been doing lead front-end work on various projects for [happiness.se](http://www.happiness.se) - [Portfolio](http://www.happiness.se/portfolio).

**Sometimes I give talks...**

Most of the stuff I have done is on Gitub... and it's opensource.
