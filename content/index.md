My name is Marcus TisÃ¤ter and I am a front-end developer based in Stockholm. My biggest passion is CSS, I strive to master it as most developers gets frustrated when it comes to writing it.

##### *"CSS takes minutes to learn but a lifetime to master".*.

**Besides** CSS, I focus on semantic markup and making everything a11y ready, I do a lot of script tooling and JavaScript - currently learning the ES6 syntax and diving into the world of React.

**Besides** learning React I work at [Happiness.se](http://www.happiness.se) creating beautiful website for well known names in Drupal and WordPress. Check out our [portfolio](http://www.happiness.se/portfolio) if you would like to browse through some of the work.

**Besides** my day-to-day job I work a lot with open source, my latest contributed project is [postcss](http://postcss.org). I also do a lot of work at [WordPress Sverige](http://wpsv.se) and you will often find me IRL on local meetups and WordCamps in Sweden.

**Besides** typing code I also write actual text on the web, my latest post was [published](https://css-tricks.com/want-make-postcss-plugin/) on CSS-Tricks.

**Besides** the internet, I do martial arts and enjoy taking walks with my bernese mountation dog, Freja.

No, I am not a robot. I am just very ambitous and driven. When I find time I do enjoy myself with a fine glas of Whisky to cool down ðŸ˜„
