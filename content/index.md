# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcus TisÃ¤ter and I work as a front-end developer for [happiness.se](http://www.happiness.se). My biggest passion is CSS, I strive to master it as most developers gets frustrated when it comes to writing it.

Besides CSS, I focus on writing semantic markup with a11y(accessibility) in mind, I do a lot of script tooling such as gulp and webpack, also MVC as React and vue.js.

**I love open source** as I am contributing to projects to help out. My latest contributed project was [postcss](http://postcss.org) were I worked closely with [Andrey Sitnik](https://github.com/ai), [Max Stobier](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) and many more developers to create [postcss.org](http://postcss.org). I also do a lot of work at [WordPress Sverige](http://wpsv.se) and you will often find me at a local WordPress meetup in Sweden as I help organizing those.

I also write actual text on the web my latest post was [published](https://css-tricks.com/want-make-postcss-plugin/) on CSS-Tricks together with Chris Coyier and I have a few more ones in plan!

Besides all this, I do martial arts and enjoy taking walks with my bernese mountation dog, Freja.

Feel free to take a look around, you can always mail me!
