# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcus TisÃ¤ter and I work as a front-end developer in Stockholm. My biggest passion is CSS, I strive to master it as most developers gets frustrated when it comes to writing it.

**Besides** CSS, I focus on writing semantic markup with a11y(accessibility) in mind, I do a lot of script tooling such as Gulp and JavaScript - currently learning the vue.js.

**I work** at [Happiness.se](http://www.happiness.se) creating beautiful website for well known big companies in Sweden using Drupal and WordPress. Check out our [portfolio](http://www.happiness.se/portfolio) if you would like to browse through some of the work.

**I love open source** as I am contributing to projects to help out, my latest contributed project was [postcss](http://postcss.org) were I worked closely with [Andrey Sitnik](https://github.com/ai), [Max Stobier](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) and many more developers to create [postcss.org](http://postcss.org). I also do a lot of work at [WordPress Sverige](http://wpsv.se) and you will often find me at a local WordPress meetup in Sweden.

**I also write actual text on the web** my latest post was [published](https://css-tricks.com/want-make-postcss-plugin/) on CSS-Tricks together with Chris Coyier and I have a few more ones in plan.

Besides all this, I do martial arts regularly and enjoy taking walks with my bernese mountation dog, Freja.
